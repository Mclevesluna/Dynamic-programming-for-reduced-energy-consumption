### ELECTRA

ELECTRA is a simulation tool designed to optimize the charging process for electric vehicles (EVs) using dynamic programming. The goal is to shift
towards smart charging by reducing current usage, maintaining minimum system load, and adjusting charging plans in real-time based on data inputs.
